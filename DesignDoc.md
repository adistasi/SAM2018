## Application Domain
This section describes the application domain.

### Overview of Major Domain Areas
Specific definitions of each domain area are available in the glossary section.  Our domain model is below, which shows the relationships between the various components of the domain.  At it's core, Users submit a Paper to the system.   PCMs request certain papers to review.  PCCs assign these papers to PCMs, who review them.  These reviews are aggregated and presented to the PCC who either rates the paper and decides the acceptance status or notifies the PCMs that they must re-review the paper and reach a consensus.  After this rating process is complete, a report is generated and displayed to the author of the paper, showing the score they recieved and the paper's acceptance status.

#### Paper Details
A paper is a submission comprised of a list of Authors, a contact author (pulled automatically from the submitting user's session information), an automated version number, a Paper Title, and a file submission (either .pdf, .doc, or .docx).

#### Rating and Review Details
A Review is comprised of a PCM's numeric ranking from 0.0 - 10.0 and any comments they may have on the paper.  A Rating is PCC's ranking from 0.0 - 10.0 and any comments they may have, but it includes (and is based on), 3 PCM Reviews for that paper.  The Rating also contains an acceptance status for the paper: Accepted, Denied, or Accepted with Modifications.

### Summary
The application uses the Java Spark Framework with Freemarker Templates to render and serve web pages to a User.  JavaScript and JSON are used to facilitate communication between the client and the server.  The project itself is split into three tiers: Appl (Application), Model, & UI (User Interface).  The application tier contains functionality to manage the state of the application and session data.  The Model tier handles the creation, validation, and management of users, papers, and reviews.  The UI tier handles passing requests and input from the Client to the Server and returning the Serverâ€™s response to the Client.  Outside of the application itself, there is a set of resources (Freemarker templates, JavaScript & CSS files, and uploaded files) that are used to render the views shown to the user.

### Overview of User Interface
Accessing the application brings the user to a log in page.  The login page prompts the user to log in by supplying a username.  Users who do not have an account may click register, which allows them to create an account as a basic user.  A successful login returns the user to the home page.  When a logged in user accesses the home page, they are able to review their notifications or access the "Manage Paper" tab.  PCC and Admin users will have the ability to access Notification Creation from the home page.  Admin Users will further be able to access the Deadline Management page from the home page.

The Paper Management tab offers a suite of functionality related to paper submissions to the SAM2018 conference.  Regular users are able to manage upload a new paper or manage and edit their existing submissions (provided the submission deadline has not passed).  PCM Users are able to use this page to access the Review Request page, where they are shown a list of paper titles to request that they review.  After the Review Request Deadline, the PCC uses this page to assign Reviews to PCM users.  The PCM users can access the Review Paper page from the Paper Management page, much like the PCC users can access the Rate Paper page from the paper management page.  PCCs & PCMs are able to use these pages to see the Reviews/Ratings they have completed and those that are still pending (which they can select and complete).

### Application Tier
The application tier is comprised of the GameCenter class that manages state functionality.  It handles validating usernames, creating and removing user accounts, and maintaining application wide references to the lists of all Model objects that have been created.

### Model Tier
The model tier handles representing the domain objects, and validating domain-object specific logic.  It contains a series of Entity Objects: Admin, Deadline, Message, Notification, Paper, PCC, PCM, Report, Review, & User.  The Entity Objects are also supported by an Enumeration classes used to standardize sets of string values across objects: AcceptanceStatus("Accepted", "Denied", & "Modify".  Following the single responsibility principle, each class as tightly focused set of responsibilites that it enforces, managing the relevant attributes and data associated with their attributes and information.

### UI Tier
The UI tier is composed of the WebServer class that initializes the TemplateEngine and GameCenter, in addition to binding various Route Handling Classes to specific URLs.  It is also composed of a series of Route Handling classes that handle HTTP GET and POST requests.  These classes are used to accept input from the user, perform any required input validation, convert the data into the appropriate format, and either pass information to the Model and Application Tier or render the appropriate template view.
